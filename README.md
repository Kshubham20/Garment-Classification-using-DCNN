# Garment-Classification-using-DCNN
Implemented a Deep Learning model pipeline for predicting the gender and western/ ethenic category of a given garment
Do the same for gender classification
Testing of model shown an accuracy of 0.62 for western/ethenic prediction and 0.72 for gender prediction

**INSTRUCTIONS**
1. Upload the folder on google drive.
2. Upload the ‘DATA_PATH’ and ‘Result_path’ as these paths may change on different
drives.
3. Mount the google drive.
4. Run the cells to import the required function.
5. Run consecutive cells to load the custom made dataset after preprocessing using
hashing, run the model, load the checkpoints and test.
